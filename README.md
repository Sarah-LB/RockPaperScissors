<h1 align="center">Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://sarah-lb.github.io/RockPaperScissors/)

This site has been created for my Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development.  It is an online Rock Paper Scissors game for the purpose of having fun!

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn how to play the game.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate the social media links to see their followings on social media and find any other games that are available.

    -   #### Returning Visitor and Frequent User Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to play and have fun.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find social media links.

    -   #### Developer and Site Owner Goals

        1. As a Developer/Site Owner, I want to build an interactive frontend site.
        2. As a Developer/Site Owner, I want to have fun playing on the game.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to make my social media links accessible in order to promote any other games I build.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The four main colours used in Rock Paper Scissors are a mustard yellow, warm orange, dark red and deep purpley blue.  These were inspired by the [Adobe Color library](https://color.adobe.com/trends/Game-design).  Yellow is associated with playfulness, happiness and fun, which suggests it would promote appropriate emotions in the user.  Blue promotes relaxation whilst orange symbolises energy, friendliness and action.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Patrick Hand font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Cursive as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Patrick Hand is a clean and clear font with the casual hand-written style adding a more fun and friendly feel.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, game play images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The bright, bold background has a fun, energetic and playful aesthetic.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, iPhone8, Samsung Galaxy A71 & iPad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly and game play was working.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs
-   When the player selected their image, the game alerts were appearing before the images appeared in the boxes.  The image sizes were reduced but this did not solve the issue.  After much research, a Timeout was set to allow the DOM to be updated before the alert is generated.
-   When the computerChoice was set to paper, the alerts were not appearing.  By logging each variable and play outcome it became apparent that once the computerChoice was set to paper, the rest of the script was not running.  There was a return at the end of the if else statement that needed to be removed.
-   The game play icons get slightly larger when hovered over.  This was originally implemented using javascript mouseenter and mouseleave but caused problems on touchscreen devices so was replaced with css hover.
-   After the user pressed ok to accept the win/lose/draw alert, the play images from that round remained which made the next round of play less clear.  A callback was used on the alert to clear the play images from the boxes on the click of the ok button.

### Known Bugs

-   No known bugs.

### Planned Improvements

-   Use [Onboarding API](https://introjs.com/) to replace How To Play page and make rules more engaging.
-   Use [Restdb](https://restdb.io/) to store and retrieve user scores and create a leaderboard.  Users would enter username on starting game.
-   Create a timer so users must select their play within a timeframe or lose that round.
